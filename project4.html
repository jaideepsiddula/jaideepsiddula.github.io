<p class="text">Twitter is a treasure trove of sentiment people around the world. 
People around the world output thousands of reactions and opinions on every topic under the
sun every second of every day. It's like one big physcological database that is constantly being updated
and we can use it to analyze millions of text messages in seconds with the power of machine learning. 
How it works......we get a input text like a tweet and we split the text into several words or sentences. 
This process is called tokenization because we are creating small tokens from big text. 
We can count the number of times each word shows up once a text is tokenised.This is called bag of words model and 
then we can look up at the sentiment value for each word from a sentiment lexicon that has it all pre recorded to
classify the total sentiment value of our tweet .the code requires twitter's APIs, dependencies and then we write our
sentioment analyser python script.Now, an API is a gateway that lets you access some servers internal functionality.
The code is...</p>
<pre><code style="background-color:#F0F8FF;font-style:bold;margin-bottom: 20px;"><b>
import tweepy
from textblob import TextBlob 

ConsumerKey='dmIW33IXeY32tHo6pUQ3g32zH'
ConsumerSecret="dsfsdfsfsffsd"          #secret

AccessToken='3069330751-W3oUvfrle0SnpNY8hCGXOePeIcRVBVdx9ZJE5wI'
AccessTokenSecret="adfadsfasdfadfasd"   #secret

auth=tweepy.OAuthHandler(ConsumerKey,ConsumerSecret)
auth.set_access_token(AccessToken,AccessTokenSecret)
api=tweepy.API(auth)
publicTweets=api.search('Trump')

for tweet in publicTweets:
  print(tweet.text)
  analysis=TextBlob(tweet.text)
  print(analysis.sentiment) 

</b></code></pre>
<p class="text">First, we create four variables that twitter will require to access tweets.
Now, we create a variale called auth for authentication and use the OAuthHandler() method of tweepy by this method. 
This method takes two arguments consumer key and consumer secret. This method i s written inside the tweepy library with a bunch
of code that is hidden to us. Next, we have to call set_access_token() method of the auth varible. This method takes two arguments
access token and access token secret. Now, we create our main variable from which we will do all of our twitter magic. We call it api
and assign it a value from the tweepy api method which takes a single authentication argument. Next, we create a public tweets variable
which stores all the tweets and to fill it with tweets we call a search method of the api variable and it takes single argument. 
Here we are choosing the key word Trump. This method is going to retrieve a bunch of tweets that contain the word Trump from here we 
can put them we can put them all out in the terminal by writing a for loop. Each tweet has a text version of it. So we perform
sentiment analysis on each tweet an print the tweet and sentiment analysis of each variable. Sentiment has two parameters called
polarity and subjectivity. Polarity measures positivity or negativity of a sentence where as subjectivity measures how much of an 
opinion it has. Sentiment analysis is the process of extracting and understanding human feelings from data and api lets you access
the servers internal functionality of Twitter tight from your app and the textblob python library lets you perform sentiment analysis.
